        <p>
        Medical conditions or health concerns are looked at either as an undesirable condition that you want to heal or control its symptoms (like the flu) or a desirable condition that you want to reach or maintain (like heart health). 
        To help you understand the impact of foods on these conditions, this application uses a variety of icons to illustrate the effects. 
        <br>
        <br><img class="effect-icon" src="../../assets/img/beneficial.png" /> indicates the food supports a positive condition or helps control an undesirable one. 
        <br><img class="effect-icon" src="../../assets/img/negative.png" /> indicates the opposite, having a harmful impact on the condition
        <br><img class="effect-icon" src="../../assets/img/assist.png" /> indicates that the food may not have a beneficial chemical in itself but helps the body absorb or process it. 
        <br><img class="effect-icon" src="../../assets/img/inhibit.png" /> indicates foods that inhibit absorption of a beneficial chemical.  
        <br><img class="effect-icon" src="../../assets/img/mixed.png" /> indicates opposing impacts that is often due to different chemicals in the same food or different impacts if the food is consumed in different forms or quantities. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Some examples:<br>
        Grapefruits (vitamin C) enhance absorption of iron from other foods, and therefore would show <img class="effect-icon" src="../../assets/img/assist.png"/> for iron deficiency (anemia). 
        <br>
        Beets on the otherhand have oxalates that interfere with the absorption of calcium, and would show <img class="effect-icon" src="../../assets/img/inhibit.png" /> for bones.
