<span class="underline">Arbitration.</span> <strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW CLAIMS THAT YOU AND {{appName}} HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.</strong>
This Section is deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and {{appName}} agree that we intend that this Section satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section can only be amended by mutual agreement.
We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us. Therefore, pursuant to these Terms and Conditions, if you have any dispute or disagreement with us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the Web Site, (ii) any data or information you may provide to {{appName}} or that {{appName}} may gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction (collectively, " {{appName}} Transactions or Relationships"), you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration. By using or interacting with the Web Site, or engaging in any other {{appName}} Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below.
We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us. If those efforts fail, by using our Web Site, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against {{appName}}, and any claim that {{appName}} may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms and Conditions, our Privacy Statement, or any {{appName}} Transactions or Relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration ("Arbitration") administered by JAMS or its successor ("JAMS") and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (respectively, the "Applicable Rules"). The Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com. If JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the "AAA") instead, and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the "Applicable Rules" in such circumstances). If JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, {{appName}} agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this Section, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e) or (i) below. Furthermore, this Section shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. You further agree that: 
<ul>
    <li>
(a) Single Arbitrator. The Arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the Applicable Rules or by mutual agreement between you and {{appName}} (the "Arbitrator");
    </li>
    <li>
(b) Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement. The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms and Conditions and/or these arbitration provisions in this Section hereof, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms and Conditions is void or voidable;
    </li>
    <li>
(c) Location of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules; or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and {{appName}}.
    </li>
    <li>
(d) Governing Law. The Arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the State of California consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any conflict of law principles; (ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with California or federal rules of procedure, as applicable; (iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;
    </li>
    <li>
(e) No Class Relief. The Arbitration can resolve only your and/or {{appName}}'s individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;
    </li>
    <li>
(f) Written Award. The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator's complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an "Award"). Judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;
    </li>
    <li>
(g) Arbitration Costs. In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, {{appName}} will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;
    </li>
    <li>
(h) Reasonable Attorney's Fees. In the event you recover an Award greater than {{appName}} 's last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award {{appName}} 's reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys' fees associated with the Arbitration, but {{appName}} shall in all events bear its own attorneys' fees; and
    </li>
    <li>
(i) Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause. With the exception of subpart (e) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor {{appName}} shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction.
    </li>
    <li>
(j) Modification of Arbitration Clause With Notice. {{appName}} may modify these arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty (30) days after {{appName}} has given notice of such modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims arising from {{appName}} Transactions and Relationships occurring after the effective date of such notification.
    </li>
    <li>
(k) Small Claims Matters are Excluded. No Class Relief or Joinder of Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against {{appName}} in your local small claims court within the U.S., if your claim is within such court's jurisdictional limit; provided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding.
    </li>
</ul>    </li>
    <li>
<span class="underline">Jurisdiction.</span> In the event of an unsuccessful arbitration, you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute with {{appName}}, resides in the courts of the State of California and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the courts of the State of California in connection with any such dispute including any claim involving {{appName}} or its affiliates, employees, contractors, officers, directors, and content providers.
<br>
These Terms and Conditions are governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any of these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition.    </li>
    <li>
<span class="underline">Termination.</span> You or we may suspend or terminate your use of this Web Site at any time, for any reason or for no reason. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue all or any aspect of this Web Site at any time without notice. 
    </li>    
    <li>
<span class="underline">Indemnity.</span> You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold {{appName}}, its officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from and against any claims, actions or demands, liabilities and settlements including without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, resulting from, or alleged to result from, your violation of these Terms and Conditions or your violation of any law, regulation or third-party right. This indemnity survives termination of these Terms and Conditions.

    </li>
    <li>
<span class="underline">General.</span>  Our delay or failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision by us. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of our Terms and Conditions remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (6) months after the cause of action arises or be forever barred.
    </li>
